This Cloudflare Worker simplifies sharing Waymo "Refer and Earn" promo codes by **automatically presenting visitors with the correct code for their local service area**, leveraging the nearest Cloudflare colocation for privacy-friendly geolocation.

Codes can be **dynamically updated** via KV storage without modifying the Worker directly, and a **deactivation notice can be configured** when monthly referral limits are reached.
